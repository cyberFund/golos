         *  another individual. The funds leave the *from* account and go into a temporary balance
         *  where they are held until *from* releases it to *to* or *to* refunds it to *from*.
         *
         *  In the event of a dispute the *agent* can divide the funds between the to/from account.
         *  Disputes can be raised any time before or on the dispute deadline time, after the escrow
         *  has been approved by all parties.
         *
         *  This operation only creates a proposed escrow transfer. Both the *agent* and *to* must
         *  agree to the terms of the arrangement by approving the escrow.
         *
         *  The escrow agent is paid the fee on approval of all parties. It is up to the escrow agent
         *  to determine the fee.
         *
         *  Escrow transactions are uniquely identified by 'from' and 'escrow_id', the 'escrow_id' is defined
         *  by the sender.
